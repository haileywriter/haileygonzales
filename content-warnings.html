      <b>Betrayal: </b>The FMC is betrayed by the MMC, but this trilogy does end with a HEA!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Captivity: </b>The FMC is held captive in the fae court by a deal against her will and 
      plots to escape. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Cliffhanger: </b>There is a cliffhanger at the end of the novel that leads to the next 
      book, but the main conflict is resolved. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Death: </b>The FMC kills her cousin accidentally after he tries to kill her, and 
      she kills enemy guards who try to kill her as well as guards from her home court 
      when she escapes. The MMC kills some guards during the solstice to protect her.  
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Knife to Throat Scenes: </b>The MMC holds a knife to the FMC's throat when they first 
      meet and threatens to kill her if she reveals his presence. This also happens when they meet 
      again. Both scenes are pretty brief and the FMC isn't truly scared for her life. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Non-Consenual Body Modification: </b>The FMC is given a magical tattoo of the Day Court 
      that can't be removed.

      <b>Teen Soldiers: </b>Several soldiers more or less don’t have a choice in becoming soldiers. 
      Her friend, Mari, is an example of this. Other than her character and the FMC, it’s not 
      explicitly stated. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Torture: </b>This occurs towards the end of the novel when the FMC tries to 
      escape and gets caught, so her grandmother makes her watch her friend get tortured. The torture 
      is described, but it isn't very detailed and focuses more on the FMC's emotions and guilt. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Toxic Family Relationships: </b>Her grandmother is the one who tricked her into 
      entering the fae realm due to a deal she didn't know about. Her grandmother won't allow her 
      to leave, and doesn't care about her grandchildren unless they obey her. Her cousin sees 
      her as a threat to his rule and tries to kill her as well.
